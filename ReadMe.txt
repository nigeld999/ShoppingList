I could have implemented a standard MVC Add, Edit, Delete view solution.

But, I decided to use a different approach to the standard MVC View framework, and try to keep all 
functionality on one page


So, after implementing the solution, I have written down improvements, if I had more time: 


Improvements: 
=============
Not call controler for adding\removal of items. i.e. implement in client side code only

Use IOC container to inject db dependency into controller

Write some unit tests
